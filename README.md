# Python-Challenge-1
This is a Python code I have developed in college. It it diviided into 10 problems:

1. Create str variables called product1, product2, and product3; assign them these strings that contain the
product's name, product price, and number of items sold of this product:
'toaster,32.75,2'
'stock pot,56.25,5'
'measuring cup,8.95,10'
Display the strings. Then display product1 in all upper case (note: numerals are not affected), product2 in all
lower case, and the number of characters in product3.

2. Extract the name, price, and items from product1 into three str variables called name1, price1, and items1
using one Python statement (i.e., do not just assign name1 as 'toaster'; think about what str function to use).
Display those three variables on separate lines. Do the same for the others using name2, price2, etc. and display
them also.

3. Re-assign price1 as a float (that is, change its type from str to float), and do the same with price2 and price3.
Re-assign items1as an int and do the same with items2 and items3. Then use a formatted print statement to
display the three prices on one line in an 8-space field with a dollar sign in front and two decimal places, like
this:
price1 =$ 32.75 price2 = $ 56.25 price3 = $ 8.95
Next, print the three items in the same way, using 5-space fields.

4. Compute the total value of each item sold; store these values in variables named amount1, amount2, and
amount3 (for example, amount3 should be 89.50). Display these values in the same way you did problem 3.
Then compute the total value sold and display it.

5. Display a table of the data so that it looks like this – the exact number of spaces is not required, but lining up
the columns is required; do NOT simply use spaces or tabs – use the print() formatting codes:
Product Price Items Value
toaster $ 32.75 2 $ 65.50
and so on for the other items. After those lines, print the total value of all three items sold, formatted and with a
label.

6. Prompt the user for a race distance given in kilometers. Convert that to miles using the formula miles =
kilometers/1.609, and display both values with labels, rounded off to two decimal places. Then prompt the user
for a race time – first the minutes, then the seconds. Compute their total time in minutes by dividing the seconds
by 60 and adding it to the minutes. Display both versions, like this:
Time: 31 minutes 15 seconds = 31.25 minutes
Then compute and display the user's speed in kilometers per minute and in miles per minute; display both with
labels and two decimal places.

7. Using the speed calculated in #6, categorize the user's rate in kilometers per minute according to this scale.
Fast: greater than 0.125 km/min; Medium: more than 0.1 km/min but not Fast; Slow: less than Medium. Display
a message like "Your speed is Fast".

8. Prompt the user for the name of a month, then prompt for a day number (like October and 22). Assign an int
variable for the month: January is 1, February is 2, and so on. Then display the date twice, in the two formats:
October 22, 2019 and 10/22/2019. Don't worry about incorrect entries (like Blurbuary or 100).

9. Assign these values to these variables: x: 2.45, y: 3, z: 10, then write Python code for the following formulas
and display their values (don't worry about rounding):
(a.) (x minus y) divided by two – as a float
(b.) (y times z) divided by seven – as an int, no remainder
(c.) (y times z) divided by seven – but *only* the remainder
(d.) the average of x, y, and z
(e). 𝑧(#$$%&'
(#$∗* )
Assign these values to these variables: s: 'Vampires', t:'ravage', u:'Pittsburgh', write Python code and display the
following using str functions:
(f.) The index of the 'a' in s, in t, and in u
(g.) s, t, and u concatenated into one string with a space between each, the result named v
(h.) Three s's (using the * operator)
(i.) Whether the letter 'z' is in u
(j.) The sum of the number of characters in s, t, and u

10. Display the values of the following Boolean expressions (using the variables in #9 – no need to re-declare
them). (Note: you don't have to write if-statements here; just print the Boolean values by putting the expression
in a print( ) statement.)
(a.) (x>5) and (x<5)
(b.) (x>5) or (x<5)
(c.) not (x == 5)
You have to write Python expressions yourself for these:
(d.) Does u have at least 5 characters?
(e.) Are t and u the same strings?
(f.) Is z greater than zero and does u contain the letter 'P'?
(g.) Is x at least zero?
(h.) Does s have at least x characters?
(i.) Is x divided by y positive?
(j.) Is the position of 'bur' in u greater than 2 but less than 5?
